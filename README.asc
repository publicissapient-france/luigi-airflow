# Execution Environments

## Preamble

These tools and instructions aims to get `Luigi` and `Airflow` complete
working environments easily.

## Pre-requisites

- Docker and docker compose
- Nginx

## Airflow

There are three main ways to setup airflow, `Sequential Executor`, `Local Executor`
and `Celery Executor`.

For all of these, please first create a directory that will be the place where you
will place your DAGs source files :

```
export AIRFLOW_DAGS=$HOME/docker/volumes/airflow-dags
mkdir -p $AIRFLOW_DAGS
```

### Airflow - Sequential Executor

```
docker run -d -p 8079:8080 -v $AIRFLOW_DAGS:\
/usr/local/airflow/dags --name airflow-seq puckel/docker-airflow
```

Go to http://localhost:8079 to check whether airflow runs properly.
